As a dietary supplement, GSH possesses various systemic effects such as improvement of liver abnormalities, improvement of diabetic complication, protection from viral infection and antitumor activity. It is even used to treat autism. Its antimelanogenic properties result from a variety of mechanisms including stimulation of pheomelanin synthesis rather than darker eumelanin, its antioxidant effects and interference with intracellular trafficking of melanogenic enzymes. Glutathione also possesses certain antiaging properties. Glutathione is generally a safe ingredient for use as a dietary supplement. In the human body, glutathione exists in two forms, reduced and oxidized (GSSG), which can be readily converted to each other.

The functions of sodium hyaluronate are based on the ability of this molecule to absorb and hold water. Sodium hyaluronate is able to hold more water than any other natural substance—up to 1,000 times its weight in water sodium hyaluronate is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a long polysaccharide (sugar molecule) composed of disaccharides called amino sugars and uronic acid. GAGs are negatively charged and thus tend to attract positively charged sodium and potassium ions. In turn, this causes the GAGs to absorb and hold a large amount of water. In the human body, sodium hyaluronate functions as a tissue lubricant and can be found wherever moisture is stored or lubrication between layers of tissue is required to eliminate friction. Examples are the vitreous body of the eye itself, the joint cartilage, the synovial fluid in the joints, all the mucus membranes of the body, and the extracellular matrix of the skin. In fact, the sodium hyaluronate found within skin account for up to 50% of the body's total store of sodium hyaluronate.",

        desc:"Leuconostoc Mesenteroides Manufacturers in India are epiphytic bacteria that are wide spread in the natural environment and play an important role in several industrial and food fermentations. Leuconostoc mesenteroides is a facultative anaerobe requiring complex growth factors and amino acids. L. mesenteroides is perhaps the most predominant LAB species found on fruits and vegetables and is responsible for initiating the sauerkraut and other vegetable fermentations. L. mesenteroides starter cultures also used in some dairy and bread dough fermentations. Commercial production dextrans and levans by L. mesenteroides, for use in the biochemical and pharmaceutical industry, has been carried out for more than 50 years. Currently, L. mesenteroides has significant roles in both industrial and food fermentations.",
